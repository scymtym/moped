* INTRODUCTION

  MOPED is the *M* eta *O* bject *P* rotocol for *E* macs *P* rograms. Its
  structure is based on the Meta Object Protocol (MOP) described in
  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_the_Metaobject_Protocol][The Art of the Metaobject Protocol]] (AMOP) by Gregor Kiozales, Jim
  des RiviÃ¨res and Daniel G. Bobrow. MOPED simultaneously implements
  large amounts of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOS][Common Lisp Object System]] (CLOS).

* INTRODUCTION

  MOPED is the *M* eta *O* bject *P* rotocol for *E* macs *P* rograms. Its
  structure is based on the Meta Object Protocol (MOP) described in
  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_the_Metaobject_Protocol][The Art of the Metaobject Protocol]] (AMOP) by Gregor Kiozales, Jim
  des RiviÃ¨res and Daniel G. Bobrow. MOPED simultaneously implements
  large amounts of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOS][Common Lisp Object System]] (CLOS).

** MOTIVATION
   Since version 23.? GNU Emacs has an integrated object system,
   called EIEIO, that implements a substantial amount of the
   frequently used parts of CLOS.

   However, EIEIO implements only a subset of CLOS and in particular
   lacks the following features:
   + Unevaluated Initforms :: From section 3.2 Slot Options of the
	EIEIO manual:
	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	The value passed to initform is automatically quoted.
	#+END_QUOTE

	The difference is illustrated by the following example:
	#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
        (defclass bla ()
          ((bla :initform (+ 1 2))))
	#+END_SRC
	In EIEIO the value of the slot =bla= will be =(quote (+ 1 2))=
	after an instance has been initialized.
   + Metaclasses :: From section 3.3 Class Options of the EIEIO
	manual:
	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	=:metaclass=

	Unsupported CLOS option.  Enables the use of a different base
	class other than `standard-class'.
	#+END_QUOTE
   + Default Initargs :: From section 3.3 Class Options of the EIEIO
	manual:
	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	=:default-initargs=

	Unsupported CLOS option.  Specifies a list of initargs to be
	used when creating new objects.  As far as I can tell, this
	duplicates the function of `:initform'.
	#+END_QUOTE
   + Generic Function Dispatch :: From section 6.1 Generics
	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	In CLOS a generic call also be used to provide an argument
	list, and dispatch precedence for all the arguments.  In
	EIEIO, dispatching only occurs for the first argument, so the
	ARGLIST is not used.
	#+END_QUOTE
   + Method Qualifiers :: From section 6.2 Methods
	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	1. There is currently no =:around= tag.

	2. CLOS allows multiple sets of type-cast arguments, where
	   EIEIO only allows the first argument to be cast.
	#+END_QUOTE
   + Dispatch on Symbols, etc ::
   + Forward Reference Classes ::
